summary: Chip Tool Matter Controller
description: |
  Chip Tool is a Matter controller being developed as part of the Connected Home IP project:
  https://github.com/project-chip/connectedhomeip.git

  The snap packaging makes it easy to run the Chip Tool on Linux distributions.

      # The project writes its data to /tmp which isn't persisted.
      #
      # Setting TMPDIR env var when running the app isn't sufficient as 
      #  chip_[config,counter,factory,kvs].ini still get written under /tmp.
      # The chip-tool currently has no way of overriding the default paths to
      #   storage and security config files.
      #
      # Snap does not allow bind mounting a persistent directory on /tmp, 
      #  so we need to replace it in the source with another path, e.g. /mnt.
      # See the top-level layout definition which bind mounts a persisted
      #   directory within the confined snap space on /mnt.
      #
      # Replace storage paths:
      sed -i 's/\/tmp/\/mnt/g' src/platform/Linux/CHIPLinuxStorage.h
      # Replace key-value store path:
      sed -i 's/\/tmp/\/mnt/g' src/platform/Linux/CHIPPlatformConfig.h
